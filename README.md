# Final Capstone

#### Hello there! Welcome to Personal Expenses, your personal expenses managing application. The purpose of this project is to help people managing their expenses and achieving their personal financial goals.

##### This is a front-end application, which retrieves data from [this API](https://github.com/tadeuasarro/track-api/tree/milestone7) that I developed.

#### Features
- Register and login using only the username
- Create and reset goals of how much money the user plans to expend
- Track expenses and sort them into six different categories
- Check a dashboard which summarizes the expenses into the categories
- Check the history log which displays the expenses info
